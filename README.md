# Design-Code
To be honest i made this project following a course(UIKit for ios 15 by Design+Code). But i learned a lot through this course for example these are the stuff that i truly can say i developed my skills on them: Collection views, Table views, auto layout, animating the tab bar, building detail view, segues and using storyboard.
